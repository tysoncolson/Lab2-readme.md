Hardware: Hard drives and memory
Latency is the average time for the sector being accessed to rotate into position under a head, after a completed seek. A transfer rate is the speed at which data is transferred to and from the disk media.
Solid state is industry shorthand for an integrated circuit, and that's the key difference between an SSD and a HDD: there are no moving parts inside an SSD. SSDs provide a huge performance advantage over hard drives â€” they're faster to start up, faster to shut down, and faster to transfer data.
With faster RAM, you increase the speed at which memory transfers information to other components. 
A 64-bit processor is more capable than a 32-bit processor, because it can handle more data at once.
